# Analyzing Layoff Patterns: From Data to Insights

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of layoff patterns using machine learning techniques. The project involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, applying various machine learning models, and interpreting the results to gain insights into layoff trends.

## Files Description

- **layoff.csv**: This dataset contains information about layoffs, including company details, location, industry, number of employees laid off, and other relevant attributes. The data is sourced from https://layoffs.fyi/ .

- **Layoff_Metrics.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook focuses on calculating and analyzing different regression metrics for the machine learning models used in the analysis. It includes evaluations of model performance using various metrics to determine the effectiveness of the applied models.

- **Layoff_analysis.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook provides a detailed analysis of the layoff data. It includes steps for data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA).This notebook offers a comprehensive look into the layoff trends and patterns through visualizations and model insights.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: Contains the layoff dataset (`layoff.csv`).
- **Notebooks**: Contains the Jupyter notebooks for analysis and metric calculations (`Layoff_Metrics.ipynb` and `Layoff_analysis.ipynb`).
- **Results**: Stores the outputs of the analysis, including visualizations and model performance metrics.

## Insights

The analysis aims to uncover trends and patterns in layoffs across different industries and locations. By applying machine learning models, the project seeks to predict layoff numbers and understand the key factors influencing these trends. The insights gained from this analysis can help organizations and policymakers make informed decisions.
